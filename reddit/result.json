I\u2019m wondering if this is a normal way to feel, when applying for your first role\n\n*** \n\nupdate below:\n\nI did not expect this post to blow up the way it did, I simply needed to let off some post interview steam and make sure I wasn\u2019t alone. The interview made me feel as if I was very inadequate as a dev due to the pop quiz kind of questions, so for those of you who took the time to respond I genuinely appreciate every one of you. It\u2019s made me feel much better about myself and future as a dev. Sorry for not getting back to everyone, but I genuinely can\u2019t thank you guys enough.. month made for sure!",

                    "selftext": "A lot of younger people who find themselves doing desktop support, perhaps at a small company, often post about how their goal is to eventually work in a data center.\n\nI think they often know what they want, but they're not expressing it well. What they really want is to be in a higher level position where they can play with and manage bigger more complex systems.\n\nThe thing is, none of this actually happens *IN* a data center.\n\nI think however they believe that this is where all the magic happens and where they want to be.\n\nYes, you want to work for a company that has all that gear but you don't want to be physically there.\n\nYou actually want to be as far from a data center as possible. They're noisy and loud and not particularly hospitable environments for humans.\n\nUsually if a company is large enough to have one or more data centers (as opposed to a server room) they're large enough to staff the data centers.\n\nThe people who actually staff the data centers generally are there to maintain the facility and the physical side of the equipment. They rack stuff, they run all the cables, they often use automated procedures to get an OS on the hardware. They also do daily audits, monitor the HVAC equipment, sign visitors in and out, provide escorts, deal with power, work with outside vendors, test the generator once a month, do maintenance on the UPS units or work with vendors to do so, etc.\n\nIt's a decent job, but it's probably not what most of you want.\n\nThe sysadmins/engineers/whatever you call them generally aren't anywhere near the data centers. At my company (and similar at many others) the sysadmins aren't even allowed in the building without an escort from one of the data center technicians. \n\nThe really big boys like Google and Amazon and others have datacenters all over the world, but the good jobs are not there. Their good jobs are in office buildings in major cities.\n\nSo, long story short, think about what you really want. It might be that what you're actually saying when you say \"i want to work in a data center\" is that you want to work for a company big enough that they have dedicated people working on vmware, linux, storage, exchange, whatever but you just don't quite know how to express it.\n\nDatacenters may look cool to those early in their careers, but the people doing the type of sysadmin work you likely want to do are not actually in those data centers, at least not on a daily basis.\n\nI haven't physically been in one of our data centers in like 2 years.",

I doubt a traditional union would work or be workable for technology workers (prima donna egos, rugged individualism, I'm too smart and good to associate with others, etc.) But the interesting thing at that this is happening at one of the FAANGs, which are supposed to be magical chocolate factories of employment happiness. Maybe this signals that enough people don't like 90 hour weeks and being guilted into not taking time off in exchange for living at an all-inclusive workplace like Google. I think it's a good thing because it shows people are realizing that there will come a point where the standard \"just quit and walk across the street for a 20% raise\" won't be possible anymore.\n\nI'm sure this will get crushed into dust by the tech companies...look at how hard Uber fought the California independent contractor status change. But I personally think that some form of professional org/guild is a very important step to turning the tech landscape closer to a traditional branch of engineering or a licensed profession and away from the Wild West we see today. The key in my opinion would be to find a way to establish a (very low) bar to ensure people have a tiny bit of basic knowledge, then find a way to allow innovation through while cementing some more useful concepts as standards when building out systems. Not easy, but it sure beats nothing or a traditional union.",

I really need to share this guys... for my mental health, and hopefully it will help some of you in a future playstore rejection journey.\n\nOk so, 4 days ago we received a lovely email from google playstore:\"Action Required: Your app is not compliant with Google Play Policies\"\n\nThe mail mention the following issue:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zjg5go7txx361.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=96ab7a47015d7d31440f70371ee2bb1655b81b7c\n\nWhich is quite weird because there is no text like this in our description, we double checked, we triple checked, I mean ... not even close... neither in english, nor in french.\n\nWe decided to release another version of the app just to try, thinking that the validator (if it was human) was maybe drunk or something...And of course we received the same email, (almost):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjycacuuxx361.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbde5ec04b4e019e69d051a8952f3f57831fdfb\n\n(Of course the screenshot linked in the mail is not accessible and redirect to \\`[login.corp.google.com](https://login.corp.google.com)\\`... otherwise it would have been easy ... LOL)\n\n(really modern UI BTW, I think we should all display random photos on our login page)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gex7rny9yx361.png?width=2828&format=png&auto=webp&s=f73d768cd3cf3c71602661ddb572d27d3802d824\n\nWe had one last idea: since the problem seems to be in english in our french description (fr\\_FR), we tried to use google translate on our own french description to see what the result is gonna be.\n\nAND SURPRISE :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf6lcdn1zx361.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3448fb282ed5bf0b237fe1268696ea33265463e\n\nYou don't need to talk french to understand that there is only ONE sentence on the left side and 3 on the right.\n\nWhat's even funnier is that we can extract the character that cause this to happen: If we copy the left content to any notepad or console we got this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzunjhl20y361.png?width=484&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e57993a6f0a26100fb1235b7a6f4fa8858fdb75\n\nIt turns out that this little \"red dot\" here mean in english \"In addition to this, you need to know more about it.\" ( Didn't know that french was that powerfull and concise)\n\nYou can try it by yourself:\n\n[https://translate.google.fr/?hl=fr&sl=fr&tl=en&text=%E2%80%8B%0A&op=translate](https://translate.google.fr/?hl=fr&sl=fr&tl=en&text=%E2%80%8B%0A&op=translate)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

The sysadmin griping about that sucky teammate who got hired because they had a wall full of certifications, but cant do anything safely. That person is real. That person exists. BUT. That person is only one slice of the pie. Prior to earning my latest Cert (RHCSA) I had about 10 years of general Linux exposure (Homelab/hobby/daily driver) and about 3 years of professional experience with Linux. A good chunk of the RHCSA was remedial. But a good chunk of it wasn't. You dont know what you dont know. There were lots of things I know how to do with Linux, but not WHY to do them. The RHCSA gave me a lot of additional insight I was previously lacking. \n\nThe issue is that people are not learning the \"why\" behind the \"what\" when they are sitting for their certification exam. They know how to turn on SELinux, but they don't understand why SELinux exists and the risk associated with a non enforcement policy. I can attest that when I was studying for my RHCSA, I learned a TON. If nothing else, the Cert process provided a tangible goal to orient my learning process around and it focused my attention.\n\nThose are my two cents. Thoughts and experiences are appreciated.",

Thank you!\n\nEdit: Here are some books that helped me:\n\n* [**Stop Getting Fd By Technical Recruiters \u2013 A Nerd\u2019s Guide to Negotiating Salary, Benefits, and Raises**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173578611X) **-**  It\u2019s like an HR for dummies made specifically for IT and CS professionals. As someone who has social anxiety and zero knowledge about negotiating salaries, doing taxes, etc, it\u2019s very helpful for me. \n* [Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3NKKUHU9EX6I2&dchild=1&keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1609733105&sprefix=atomic+habits%2Caps%2C358&sr=8-1) \\- this helped me break my bad habits (work and personal) and this is honestly one of the very few realistic self-help books out there. Every progress matters!\n* [The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3LUUB7GD8POWF&dchild=1&keywords=the+daily+stoic&qid=1609733596&s=books&sprefix=the+daily+stoic%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C365&sr=1-1) \\- If you want to go back to reading, I highly recommend this book. Reading one page a day is better than nothing. The philosophies aren\u2019t really life changing, but it\u2019s a good starting point from a reading slump.",
